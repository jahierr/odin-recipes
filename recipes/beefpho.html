        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
                <li>Make broth; Place beef bones in a 9-quart pot;
                    season with 1 teaspoon salt. Pour water into the pot and bring to a boil.
                    Reduce heat and simmer broth for about 2 hours.</li>
                
                <li>Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat
                    the oven's broiler. Line a 10x15-inch roating pan with aluminum foil.
                </li>

                <li>Place onions and unpeeled ginger onto the prepared roasting pan and cook under the preheated broiler, 
                    stirring occasionally, until vegetables are charred, 10 to 15 minutes. </li>
                <li>Cool slightly. Chop onions, then peel and slice ginger; set aside separately. </li>
                <li>
                    Skim fat from surface of simmering broth. Add oxtail, radish, and charred onions to broth. 
                    Tie charred ginger, anise, cinnamon stick, peppercorns, and cloves in cheesecloth to make a bouquet garni; 
                    add to broth. 
                    Stir in sugar, fish sauce, and remaining 2 teaspoons salt. 
                    Simmer over medium-low heat for at least 4 hours (the longer, the better). Season with salt. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Strain broth. Discard bones and bouquet garni. 
                    Reserve meat from bones for another use. 
                    Chill broth in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Skim and discard fat from the top of chilled broth. Pour broth into a pot; bring to a boil. 
                    Reduce heat and keep hot until ready to serve. 
                </li>                
                <li>
                    Bring a pot of water to a boil. Turn off heat. 
                    Stir in rice noodles and let sit until noodles are tender yet chewy, 6 to 10 minutes. 
                </li>                
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, cut frozen sirloin into paper-thin slices. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drain and divide noodles among bowls, about 1 1/2 cups per serving. 
                    Top each with a few sirloin slices. Ladle hot broth over sirloin and noodles. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve and enjoy!
