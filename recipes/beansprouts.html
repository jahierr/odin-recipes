        <p>
            Korean Bean Sprouts Side Dish is so refreshing and easy to make. 
            It only takes 10 minutes to make this Korean ban-chan (side dish) staple. 
            I love how fresh and crunchy the bean sprouts are, and the light flavors makes it an amazing side dish 
            that goes with all of your favorite dishes!

                uncovered, until tender yet still crisp, about 15 seconds. Drain in a colander then 
                immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process.
